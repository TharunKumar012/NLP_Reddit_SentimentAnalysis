Occasionally see in some threads people getting really antsy about nothing happening, but this all feels like great pacing and build up to what we just saw. 

Daemon basically experiencing slight ego-death after taking psychedelics and confronting issues with his dead brother. All for him to still try to seize power as the king, until he saw a better man in Oscar Tully outplay him with the very words Dameon used to set up his own power. Daemon from episode 2/3 could not have done that. 

Watching The Queen amass her army of dragon riders after trying literally everything else. She sees the cost it will take with her relationship to her son. But we‚Äôve also watched some really great stories of these dragon riders and how their personality is going to pair with the dragons. And I mean, DID Y‚ÄôALL SEE ALL THOSE DRAGON SHOTS??

From Hugh‚Äôs confession to his wife, his mother said ‚Äúyou are no different to my brother‚Äôs boys, Viserys and Daemon‚Äù. Means that Hugh‚Äôs mother might be a bastard daughter of someone in Jaeherys‚Äôs generation. 

Hugh might be a bastard grandchild of Jaeherys, the rider of Vermithor. Vermithor sensed Jaeherys‚Äôs blood inside Hugh‚Äôs vein.

That brief glimpse of her in the background, and then when she woke up. As soon as I saw her, the first thought in my mind was ""She's *beautiful*."" 

Syrax still holds the top spot in my heart, but I would say that the older Silverwing is perhaps the second most beautiful dragon we've seen.

And speaking of new faces, Vermithor's a badass. I honestly think that with his appearance this week, Vermithor has taken a very comfortable lead in my book as the most awesome-looking dragon. He ain't pretty the way Syrax or Silverwing are, but he's awesome in his own right.

I've been waiting since the first glimpse we got of the Bronze Fury last season to see these two, and I gotta say they knocked 'em both out of the park, design-wise.",15,2024-07-29 02:34:42

-Previously: After a genealogy-inspired recruitment went awry, Seasmoke decided he'd just pick his own new dad. 

-If you ever feel worthless, just remember that there is a ‚Äúskip intro‚Äù button for the opening credits of this show. 

-Well, they cut straight to Rhaenyra's meeting with Addam. Probably a good move. 

-Addam currently having the weirdest job interview ever. 

-‚ÄúWhispers best left to the wind‚Äù... as opposed to words are wind?

-Lord Bartimos, if the dragon will let the lowborn ride him, there's not much you can do, good ser. 

-Mysaria is basically like ‚ÄúYour ancestors fucked. A lot.‚Äù

-Awwww, dad is proud of Addam.

-First time in awhile we got a visit to Harrenhal without it starting with a freaky dream. 

-Ah, Riverlands drama. Nothing like it. 

-And now, back to Spooky Harrenhal Theater! With bonus Paddy Considine!

-Damn, that is some good makeup/prosthetic work on Aegon. 

-""Hey, just wanna let you know, you might be able to ride a dragon, NBD."" 

-Jace: Not a fan of the smallfolk, racial supremacist. 

-Also a hypocrite, AS HE HIMSELF POINTS OUT he's hardly all Valyrian.
 
-Who among us hasn't talked about riding dragons while out with the boys?

-So Alicent is going through some stuff, taking nice long walks in the forest, chilling in the water. That type of thing. 

-My Valyrian is rusty, any ideas what she just said with the dragonkeepers?

-Rhaenyra doing all the exposition, giving the Pokedex entry for Vermithor. 

-Vermithor looks great.

-Well, I guess most of those people didn't have enough badges to train him!

-BURNINATING THE DRAGON CAVE! BURNINATING THE DRAGONSEED!

-Vermithor: ""Oh, hey, you've got guts. I respect that. Want to be my new dad?""

-STOP: Hugh Hammertime!

-Is that.... dragon shit?

1. The dragons. It's a bit obvious. Even someone who would be introduced with the ASOIAF universe with this episode would recognize the scene at the end. 

2. Oscar Tully. Again, quite obvious because of the performance of the actor. But there were also some subtle parts I really enjoyed with his scenes. The way he bested Daemon was great. But I also really liked how Daemon handled being bested. 

3. The most important thing I liked. Jace. 

Firstly, Rhaenyra made her argument very simply. Very pragmatic. Exactly how I had been feeling this entire season. What else would you have her do? That's why I really like her as a character. 

But secondly, when Jace made his case for why he was upset about the situation, it just made so much sense. I don't agree with him at all, but the way he laid it out does add up. Really wonder how it will all play out because he could end up being right.",5,2024-07-29 20:11:40

The Jace scene was terrific, but I didn‚Äôt like that it still let Rhaenyra off the hook.  I would have preferred the leaked version where their conversation was more heated.  Also not keen on Jace using derogatory language to talk about commoners.  Rhaenyra has never done that, so I can only guess this is another thing they‚Äôre going to blame on Daemon.  

Aegon‚Äôs scene of him struggling to walk was heartbreaking.  What does it say that Larys is the only person to not let Aegon give up on himself?  

Alicent feeling dirty all season and wanting to be clean coming full circle.  Her walking in nature and laying in the water to be reminded not everything is corrupt in the world.  She feels so much guilt, but she thought it was at least for a righteous reason.  Knowing it‚Äôs not, but it‚Äôs too later, has her dead inside.  

Daemon‚Äôs still being needlessly punkish.  I don‚Äôt get how he doesn‚Äôt seem remotely different after all the therapy.  

The dragonmont scene was insane, topped every expectation I had.  Vermithor was a beautiful, grumpy boy, and seeing Silverwing had eggs üò≠.  I wonder if she‚Äôs Syrax‚Äôs mother, they have a similar head and horns.  Was rad as hell to see Aemond have to turn memaw V around when he saw pepaw V there to greet them.

lfh88z7,woodpecker91,"Loved the episode for a lot of reasons but wanted to talk about one scene in particular I enjoyed and how it had another meaning I think some people haven't considered. I think the scene with Oscar Tully and Damon also supports Jace's argument later in the episode regarding the risk of letting lowborn bastards have dragons. When Rhaenyra is considering the pros and cons in her study, Mysaria makes a pretty good point about how her highborn brothers aren't being very honourable right now and Rhae shouldn't let birth status dissuade her from potential military assets. The problem is in the world of Westeros, lowborn people aren't given the education/preparation for the responsibilities of being in positions of power because they're never expected to be in one.

When Oscar Tully arrives at Harenhal, we see from his very first interaction with Damon that he's not a fool or pushover despite his age. He makes it clear to Damon that while he intends to honour the vow of the previous lord, he doesn't approve of Damon's actions and his support is not unconditional. By using his words to maneuver Damon into a position of having to punish his man for following his orders, Oscar demonstrated to the river lords he is not weak and can stand up for them if needed to the crown. He wins their respect while maintaining the honour of his family vows. I would argue that is a product of growing up in a noble household with the relevant educational advantages. You can tell he was raised right with a strong sense of duty and honour. I think this scene while being awesome on its own also supports Jace's argument later about what happens if the lowborn bastard Targs (who've never had any power or influence in their life) are suddenly in charge of flying disasters. They haven't been taught since birth how important their personal honour is, how important their vows are, they have no proven record of loyalty you can point to like Steffon Darlyn did.

Before anyone says it, of course there are plenty examples of nobles breaking their word in GOT and HOTD, but that's the point. It's a big bloody deal when it happens, history shaping events, it's not something that happens often. Nobles have generations of ancestors they can point to as personal guarantees of their honour. Starks never break their vows, a Lannister always pays their debts, etc. You don't know anything about these Targ bastards, how they were raised, what their true personalities are or how they'll react to having power. I suspect at least one will break ranks, I almost thought Ulf was looking to defect when we saw him flying over King's Landing.

Like you'll need to replace the Lord Paramount of the Westerlands, Replace the Lord Paramount of the Stormlands; you have abandoned/ruined castles in Riverlands (Old Stones) and the Crownlands (The Whispers).

That we'd understand more of her mindset for why she didn't kill herself.

But everything else was excellent. The riverlords council scene was great pay-off to Daemon's struggle with the local politics, and I loved seeing Paddy one more time. It's a perfect way to end it, his mental struggle, that Daemon finally gets offered what he wanted all along. People complained that we didn't get to see an emotional side to Daemon in s1, and here you have it. And of course the dragon claiming scene was an amazing spectacle and I'm so happy that they didn't show Silverwing in the promotions, so the design was an equal surprise to everyone.

2. Burn the kings landing scorpions
3. Burn the gates and archers on the ramparts (if they haven't already fled)
4. Corlys' fleet lands and Kings Landing and red keep is sacked with minimal losses especially to smallfolk


Mysaria must be informed through her spies that Vagar rests in a field fairly far outside Kings Landing completely exposed.¬† A nighttime diving attack by 3 to 4 dragons would surely end her.¬† If they refrain from using fire, which would likely be useless anyway, They would be outside the range and view of the¬† scorpions.
Alternatively, draw Vagar out with a little dragon, and then surprise attack with the others.


After controlling Kings landing, all that is left is to subdue Cole's army and The Lannisters. The Lannisters will kneel when they see the power imbalance favoring the blacks. Cole is done.


The rest of the holdouts in the kingdom will bend the knee with a simple multi dragon flyby.

Mysaria remains elusive to me. She's in the shadows, doing the Queen's bidding. Their relationship seems professional, but changed. There's a trust there that didn't exist before. I fear this won't bode well for the future. Her ideas, on the other hand, should be used. She is a powerful pawn in this war. I wonder how long she'll remain so?¬†¬†

Daemon, I'm sure, never expected to be beaten by a child. I adore the actor for Oscar Tully. He silenced Daemon with one question. Suddenly, I have a new favorite character! That was a really great scene. Daemon sees what being a king is really like; others paying for your mistakes. He could live with it, as long as he wasn't personally involved. Ser Simon Strong, though, was the star of this scene. His side-eyes were perfection. I don't really know what to think of Daemon's vision. I assume Daemon realized the crown was too much, but who can say? I like how Matt Smith phrased it. He has to decide if he needs this ornament, or just wants it. I am curious to see why, and for who, he leads the army.¬†¬†

Alicent's scenes were mostly filler. But, I loved the cinematography. It was very Shakespearean. Overcast day, with a clear lake that bent to her will. I like that the hawk, in the sky, looked similar to a flying dragon. I have a feeling the writers were stuck in a rut. Still, they did their best. It was nice to see Alicent get to be a person.¬†¬†

The bastards scene...my god, that was intense. Rhaenrya is getting the taste for glory Foreshadowed, I suppose, by her argument with Jace. That was heart-breaking. She, in that moment, chose herself over her son. It's a turning point in her character arc. In season 1, she would have put an end to the slaughter. In season 2, she just waits for the victor to appear. On a positive note, I loved how they had the dragons choose their riders. It felt like an ancient ritual. The High Valyrian could've sung me to sleep.¬†¬†

The ending of this episode was iconic. It will go down as one of the most epic sequences either franchise can offer. That last shot, of Rhaenyra silently saying ""Come and get me, I dare you"" was a sight to behold. The acting, the action, the plot...this was technically perfect.¬†",3,2024-07-30 04:35:24

I guess Vhagar is too big for the dragon pit.

lffngfx,Sorsha_OBrien,"I liked this episode but they kept cutting scenes I wanted to see!  
  
Like was anyone else a bit disappointed when the episode started with Rhaenyra and Addam on the ground? Yes, it was a cool shot and opening, but I wish they had showed us Rhaenyra seeing/ finding Addam in the sky and being like, 'Who is this guy?' and like gesturing him/ telling him to land. We could have experienced this WITH Rhaenyra but instead it cut to what would have been a really interesting and fun scene to watch and just jumped right to them meeting each other on the ground (also a good and interesting scene but idk, this was her first time seeing a non-Targ person claim/ ride a dragon and her first time meeting this person and we didn't get to see this from the get go).  
  
Likewise, when it was announced to the Black Council about Addam, however, Rhaenyra wasn't even present/ didn't even come in and communicated this to them? It would have also been cool if Rhaenyra came in WITH Addam to the counsel, and told them how it was going down, rather than just going off to Mysaria and wondering how to find more Targaryens. Like, you're the Queen yet you're not really communicating with the people you need to help win the war? What? It likewise would have been cool to see the nobles react to Addam, this new dragon rider, with him in the room. It could have been a juicy scene with Rhaenyra standing her ground and Addam feeling out of his depth/ out of place with all these nobles around him. Honestly they better do some scene in the future where all the lowborn dragonseeds are sitting at a table and you can see the class differences btw them, like how they view the food, how they talk/ the slang they use, etc.  
  
Likewise with Aemond and Vhagar -- it again just jumped from Aemond mounting Vhagar to Aemond getting to dragonstone and seeing the dragons. I'm not asking for a five minute long chase, or even a chase!, but it would have been cool to see Aemond's reaction etc. as he's chasing Silvering and Ulf out of King's Landing. Like with Rhaenyra witnessing Seasmoke and Addam, we could have seen Aemond being like, 'Who tf is riding this dragon?' and seeing some random guy on the back. We could see as Ulf kind of freaks out and is like, 'Shit, fly me back to Dragonstone!' to Silvering, and how he's worried about Aemond and Vhagar. But again, we barely see this. It's like they skip the scenes where character's actually experience things (and we experience it with them) to scenes that happen right after. Like if you have an interesting/ cool scene that shows character reactions like this, why skip it? \[Ik ik, bc of time constraints and there only being like ten episodes. Like WHY does HBO/ whoever is in charge of this make the seasons so short? 13 episodes would have been ideal and there could have been so much more character development and interactions\]",2,2024-07-29 03:08:30

Where is Otto??? Didn‚Äôt Aemond send for him? And Daeron‚Äôs dragon has taken to wing means what? He is on his way? His dragon was too young to fly and is now flying?

That young dude immediately makes it clear that he won't take any shit from a king or anyone. They have to follow the river land rules and anyone who breaks them needs to die, even if ordered by a king. I really thought that daemon will forgive him but I guess not.

So finally now we know that dragons seek out lineage more than courage. I mean that's clear from this episode. Also, I really like that they're showing so much of the dragon's life style here. I wish they make a special episode with how they live and how the riders take care of the dragons. Maybe a special extra.

I guess now daemon is feeling the burden of the crown. This should humble him.

But... Why the everliving wtf would Rhaenyra not teach the group the most basic Valyrian commands, just a tiny bit of coaching before sending them onto a dragon's lunch tray? That just seems like terrible writing. The part where Rhaenyra calls in Valyrian to Vermithor was soulshakingly unnerving and gave a feeling of magic, but for her to then just leave them to it without a single word of advice or guidance felt jarring af. Her pre-dragon ""pep talk"" in the waiting room was mostly just her babbling in fancy speak, and when the big moment came, a moment that surely would be heard of in the entire realm, she just sends them all in in a group without any tools at their disposal.

The only way it makes sense is if she wanted them to die, which honestly doesn't feel too far from the truth. That was one of the things I liked about this episode: it really highlighted what shitty, terrible people every single one of these noble family characters are. Jace especially, what a cunt of a kid, crying like a baby because ""wah wah my kind of but not really birthright is threatened by mongrels"".

Complaints aside, though, the Vermithor scene was badass. And I could listen to Rhaenyra speak Valyrian all day long. Her ""*Dohaer***a***s*"" was cool as hell, and I loved the self-satisified half-smirk when she realized she had gained Vermithor's obedience.",2,2024-07-30 16:10:36

It had everything this show was set out to be, just enough intimate scenes, just enough quarreling, and LOADS of Dragons and Dragon Lore (the fact that even the dragon keepers turned on her in the name of the legends)


Visually, it felt like such a treat to see these two new dragons, along with Seasmoke and Syrax as well, in action even though they're not yet in full action. SILVERWING IS SO FREAKIN BEAUTIFUL, SHINING LIKE A METALLIC PLATED BEAST IN KL's sunlight.¬†


Honestly, and this I say not with any disrespect, if anyone found even TODAY'S episode slow, then they really do have an attention span issue. Today's episode, much like episode 4, was categorically a perfect example of how to properly pace AND WRITE a story in 3 acts, with the 3rd act being all too powerful.¬†


Also, Rhaenerya's saying that for 20 years she's been taunted by the westerosi for the lineage of her sons, now she's going to raise an ARMY OF BASTARDS ü§£ü§å


Almost every character was perfectly written in this episode, and it was, as I said, a visual treat. But, I'm so happy to see that it was SO MUCH MORE.


AAAAAALSO, NEXT WEEK, THEY'RE SHOWING TESSARION?!?!?!?!?!? AND TEASING DREAMFYRE ?!?!?!?!?!?




I vehemently stand by my theory/prediction that this season ends with either a tease, for the initial scenes of the fall of KL, with Rhaenerya's bringing in all her so far accumulated dragondriders.

* Overall though... This season feels like outside Rook's Rest battle just another build up. Gotta position all the pieces again to have the big battles with dragons next year (or likely 2 ugh). Just feels like with only 8 episodes they still managed to have about 50% of it be filler
* Daemon's whole plotline this season was awful, I'm sorry but he was my favorite character last season. I have to imagine Matt Smith is bored out of his mind because he looks it.
* You REALLY feel the downgrade in acting and power on screen this 2nd half. Losing Rhy Ifans, Viserys not being alive, and Daemon stuck in ghost vision land.

Vermithor: what a fantastic beast. It actually looks a bit like Vhagar, similarly bulky, saggy. 

Concerned about Jace. They seem to be pointing to his position as heir could be questioned, either by a brother (he mentions the thing about his hair, while Rhaenyra's younger sons do have  white hair) or perhaps some lords questioning him again? Also his speech about how the lords are bound by honor and peasants are not seems foreshadowing. For a moment, I thought Ulf was gonna surrender Silverwing to the Greens right then and there. 

Because that's the thing: this war could be over right now with a very bloody coup: make Aemond come back with Caraxes, join him with Vermithor, Vermax, Sirax, Silverwing and Seasmoke and... that's pretty much it for the Greens isn't it? they could take King's Landing right now. Two of the biggest take care of Vhagar, three even, the rest reduce the King's soldiers to ashes. Dreamfyre hasn't a warrior rider, Sunfyre is probably not ready to fly and by how they made it sound, Tessarion - who's anyway too far away right now - is just taking to flight with a rider for the first time, so I assume is a very small dragon, Arrax type. 

One stroke, war's over. Aegon can't face them in battle, nor dispute their claims with how he's right now - dizzy with poppy milk, scarred, weak -, Aemond falls with Vhagar... Otto by himself has no claim, nor Alicent, and Helaena or her daughter would suffer the same mysoginy Rhaenyra faced, so surely won't be considered.",1,2024-07-29 10:56:43

Tell me if I'm missing something about Jace's character but why is HE the one that's mad that all these bastards are here, when he was literally the one to suggest finding dragonseeds in the first place. Granted, he wanted high born dragonseeds, but I don't really get his outrage in getting bastards to ride dragons. Brother, if it helps you win the war, who do you get who rides the dragons? It's also weird how he says all this when in previous episodes he was literally like calling out Targaryen propaganda ('Valyrian histories, written to gild us in glory'), so it's weird now that he's like 'we can't let those mongrels be dragon-riders'. Idk, I get how perhaps he has like internalised anti-bastadry or anything, but ugh, you've known since a young age that you were likely a bastard! Idk, I feel like half the characters they make into hypocrites to explain bad writing rather than explore the hypocrisy?  
  
I also get from his standpoint why he would be wary of this -- because it calls into question his own bastardry and thus claim to power, but also because it could likely be a great way to smear the Blacks, i.e. the Greens could say that the Blacks are so weak that they had to elevate bastards into dragon riders, while other nobles would likely be annoyed that lowborn bastards are now dragon-riders/ to closer proximity than the Targaryen family, and the Greens again could again say that 'the bastard needs bastards to win his war' (or something like this, and thus further spread that Jace is a bastard).  
  
However, Jace seems to be more upset from a PERSONAL side of things, which in part is fair -- we haven't really scene him confront Rhaenyra about his bastardry -- but idk, it felt like a bit of a heel turn for Jace, since HE was the one that was like 'we need riders, not dragons' and HE was the one that said 'Valyrian histories, written to gild us in glory'. Now he's calling bastards mongrels when we've never seen him be discriminatory towards bastards? Idk, I get his anger at Rhaenyra, especially when keeping him out of the conversation, but I think the dialogue/ scene could have been written better. Like Rhaenyra wasn't like, 'You were the one that said we should find more dragon-riders,' even though this was his idea, not Mysaria's (as he says). Also, it was Mysaria who saved Rhaenyra's life (by alerting the guards about the twins switching) AND had the idea to send aid across the blockade, culminating in a riot.

Oscar Tully‚Äôs young actor was really good as was that whole scene. Finally something worthwhile came from this Daemon storyline and then it goes right back to the dreams and day dreams. They‚Äôve stretched it out now for over 6 episodes. Enough is enough seriously. To say it‚Äôs dragging is an understatement.

I wish this wasn‚Äôt so overhyped in advance though because it in absolutely no way as a whole was one of the best GoT episodes ever made.

And, as much as I love the ending, I don‚Äôt understand how Syrax and Vermithor are so small looking in stature. Especially, if vermithor is second biggest to vhagar, and vhagar looks huge. But, in the last sequence both vermithor and syrax looks small when standing close to Rhaenyra. In season one syrax looks a good medium size but lately she‚Äôs looking smaller especially compared to when she‚Äôs beside rhaenyra.

Another venting unpopular opinion, the show producer says this is the best episode of any GOT and HOD season. I don‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs smoking, the episode was good, better than many of the episodes this season. But, with the way the writing has been, the show can barely compare to the first 3 seasons of GOT.

This season feels less and less like classic GOT(apart from the Oscar Tully scene). I wish they spent some time with the nameless bastards or gave them some backstory before being burned to a crisp. Just by sheer screen time you could tell who will be the new dragon riders. 0 suspense. Same as with the Rhaenyra and Adam scene- why tease it like he could have done anything else other than kneel to her? He has no reason to/ motivation than to pledge his allegiance. 
Don‚Äôt get me wrong its still my favourite show on right now but it feels so much weaker than season 1 which felt like this could be another show of the calibre of GOT. Now i am not so sure anymore. The dragons are definitely an improvement tho. 
Hope they course correct for s3 and spend more time with side characters who are not immediately relevant to the plot to give the world a bit more life.

Definitely an improvement on the last 2. But the first 40 minutes was season 2 at its worst, yet again. The conversation between Rhaenyra and Jace was very good. Some good Corlys stuff too. And Larys with Aegon. Everything else was utter drivel. Allisons scenes were pure filler. And nothing Daemon can do from here will save this arc. If this is what the writers think character development is, they need to take a break and go watch True Detective. Character development isnt floating in the water or having acid trips.

Its just so bad. The show hasn't gone to Game of Thrones seasons 5-6 levels of bad yet, but this season is closer to those two than to GOT S1-4 in terms of writing quality.

As for the ending. Great visuals. A lot unexplained (I thought Dragons obeyed High Valyrian), but ok, maybe its all just BS or will be explained later. Ulf getting a dragon just like that is kind of meh and an unsatisfying/unearned conclusion to the arc. But I'm glad we finally got wtf these small folk people were introduced for (too bad the writers didnt figure out a way to make these characters interesting before this moment.)

But that last scene was ATROCIOUSLY bad. It was like comedy level bad. Dragonstone is not that close to Kings Landing, and even if it is why would you immediately take your dragon there and fly around. Even if you could argue its to do X and Y, its just a goofy, unnecessary scene that completely broke my immersion.

So Rhaena is just going to leave the young kids she was charged to protect and look after to go look for a dragon she doesn't even know where it is?! ok makes sense.

Now some will say well the other 2 couldn‚Äôt fight yet they‚Äôre just new dragon riders. But if you accept that logic then she made an absolutely moronic decision to lure Aemond cause it‚Äôs still a 1v1 fight then between her and him. 

So all she has succeeded in doing is letting her enemy know she‚Äôs stronger and can let them prepare accordingly. 

I made a post last episode saying how moronic it is she doesn‚Äôt do a sneak attack at night to wipe out Aemond because of the distance he‚Äôd have to travel to get to Vhagar first. And tonight not only is that point proven but proven even more than I could have expected seeing as he has to go OUTSIDE the city. And the dragon got right up to the Red Keep during the DAY. If Rhaenyra was the dragon rider Aemond and the entire green faction except Alicent would be dead, and she‚Äôd be queen.

First we see Silverwing flying over King's Landing and Aemond going to get Vhagar. Then suddendly it cuts to Aemond in Dragonstone? After searching it up i realized its implying Aemond followed Silverwing to Dragonstone, but that wasn't really clear when watching the scene. Also, what the hell was Rhaenyra's plan? Did she think Aemond would just follow Silverwing to Dragonstone and there they could ambush Vhagar with all the dragons? That's stupid. And now they gave away the fact they have all those dragons and lost the surprise factor that could have been usefull. 

About the confusion part, i feel like all they needed was a few more shots, perhaps just show us Silverwing running away from Vhagar in King's Landing and then cut to them arriving in Dragonstone. Feel like that would've been enough. About the second part, this whole scene just feels stupid and unnecessary for the reasons listed above and just an excuse to have a cool moment with Aemond scared to end the episode.

I know Ulf was laughing like a madman and not acting like he was springing a trap or in danger, but it is possible they knew Vhagar was kept outside the city and that Ulf was effectively in no danger given how long it would take Aemond to get in the air.

They also hate him because they believe he is the one responsible for the assassination of Aegon's son. When Daemon was introducing Oscar as the new lord of the riverlands, he was trying to make it sound like Oscar was declaring loyalty to him, which was a blunder fueled by pride. Oscar knew that if he was a meak with Daemon it would result in the Riverlords not abiding by his decision, and possibly a civil war would erupt. Oscar instead cleared the air by pretty much saying ""we are following king Viserys' wishes and following Queen Rhaenera. We reconize you as king consort, but you are not our ruler"". He played up that hatred, showed that he wasn't a rug for Daemon to walk over, which in turned, showed the riverlords that he wasn't weak. Oscar understood the assignment and carried it out. It's also possible that Daemon understood this and went along with it, even if begrudgingly.",63,2024-07-29 02:20:39

I mean it was being spread loudly in a tavern, tons of people must have known. Especially after being tipped off by Lord Jasper Wylde about Seasmoke, Larys would‚Äôve known by the end of the night the recruitment had happened, wouldn‚Äôt he? 

It makes me think Larys purposefully held it away from Aemond. Interesting that his strategy is hedging his bets against ousting Aemond with superpowering Team Black? Does that not seem like a risky strat?",22,2024-07-29 04:00:24

I really like how Vermithor and Silverwing embody the personalities of their new riders. One is strong and stern with a commanding aura around it that shows such ferocity and anger in such a limited time while the other, interestingly, conveys a more playful demeanor that seems more eager to have fun and enjoy the thrills.

I agree wholeheartedly. Their respective stories, and Adam's as well, are what has been really making the season for me.

His status as a dragonrider cemented his position as a true Targaryen, so he now has a problem with Rhaenyra recruiting bastard dragonlords because it removes that last ‚Äúproof‚Äù that he is trueborn.

I think he sees the bad position that Viserys put his mother in by naming her as heir, even though he knew part of the realm wouldn't accept a woman to rule them. He set her up for failure and Jace sees his mother struggle to prove her claim. And he knows that if she wins, whenever she eventually dies, the same thing will happen to him. He knows the realm will see him as a bastard and not accept his claim, and the one thing he has for his argument that he is a 'true Targaryen' is that he was able to claim a dragon. However, his mom is about to prove that bastards can ride dragons too. Rhaenyra is inadvertently making sure that Jace's claim will be threatened when it is time for him to ascend, and that he will have to go to war as well.

""some species, such as the Nile crocodile, the female will actively guard the nest and may even help to excavate the nest or move the hatchlings to water once they have hatched. This behavior is more common in species that build mound nests, where the female actively regulates the temperature and humidity of the nest.

However, in other species, such as the saltwater crocodile, the female may build a nest and lay her eggs but then leave the nest unattended. In these cases, the eggs are left to develop and hatch on their own without any parental care.

Overall, while some crocodile species do exhibit some level of parental care for their eggs, the extent and nature of this care can vary depending on the species.""",18,2024-07-29 13:14:24

lfmllbf,FigureFourWoo,"Aemond's response was correct. He sees an enemy dragon. A smaller one he can easily take down with Vhagar. Plus, it's a dragon who previously had no rider, and until this point, only the Targaryans could ride dragons. He saw an opportunity wipe out an enemy dragon, plus a blood relative of the usurper. He likely thought it was Daemon's daughter, since she previously hadn't claimed a dragon.

He gives chase through the air. Dragonstone is a lot closer by dragon than it is by land. Once he realizes Silverwing is getting close to Dragonstone, he pulls back, because he knows there are a lot of dragons there, even if the heavy hitters don't have riders. As soon as he pulls back and gets control of Vhagar, he realizes it was a wise decision because there are *multiple* dragons waiting with riders.

Realistically, this all falls on the Lord of Whispers. He got the whisper about Seasmoke having a rider. If he had informed Aemond, then Aemond might not have gone chasing after Silverwing on Vhagar.

As it stands now, Aemond knows there are riders for multiple dragons that previously didn't have riders, and a couple of those dragons could take Vhagar if they teamed up.

Smart move would have been to fly back to base. It military terms it's called the Principle of Calculated Risk.

Adding some additional context: While team Black has the numbers, until they added these new dragon riders this episode, Vhagar basically was not threatened by anything other than the combined efforts of all of team Black's dragons, and even then would likely kill them.

The guy Oscar wanted dead is Ser Willem Blackwood, who is the uncle of the child Lord Blackwood. House Blackwood, and House Bracken, a different house in the Riverlands, have an ancient feud going back centuries, and both declared for opposite factions, with the Blackwoods siding with Rhaenyra and the Brackens siding with Aegon. 

At the start of episode three, we saw the aftermath of the battle between the Brackens and the Blackwoods at the Burning Mill, and later we saw Daemon meet with Lord Amos Bracken to try to convince him to switch sides and support Rhaenyra. Lord Bracken refused even with Daemon threatening him with Caraxes, so he dispatched Willem Blackwood to raid Bracken lands to force them to yield, which was successful. 

However, the raiding was denounced by the other lords in the Riverlands since they killed or kidnapped innocent smallfolk, and destroyed holy septs. They all showed up at Harrenhal an episode or two ago to announce their opposition to Daemon since he ordered it all, and since Oscar also disapproved the raids being done to the lands of his bannermen, he had Daemon execute Willem for his crimes.",5,2024-07-29 03:02:06

also, it seems that dragons have wildly differing personalities and different intensities of bonding with their rider. for example, we've seen vhagar disobey aemond several times, and he has to yell at her and tug on the reins to get her to bey. on the other hand you have caraxes who doesn't even need verbal commands from daemon to do exactly what daemon needs of him. we've seen vermithor roast everyone who so much as looks at him, but silverwing seems to be no fiercer than a large dog.",2,2024-07-30 06:01:14

I think they did it differently in the show for a few reasons: 1. It would just be a boring to watch each dragonseed go up to Vermithor one at a time--too visually similar to the Darklyn episode. 2. You already know which two are claiming dragons, since we've been following them for a bit. You at least know one of them will.

The three of them first stopped at the Vale to drop off Joffrey with Lady Arryn so he could live with her as her ward, and they'd stay with Lady Arryn until the boat, the Gay Abandon, to take them to Pentos was secured. While they are hanging about the Vale, Rhaena notices big burnt areas, and asks Lady Arryn about them--she says something about how Arryn hasn't been honest with her in ep6. Turns out there is a wild dragon running around the Vale. Those who read the book are thinking it's probably the wild dragon known as Sheepstealer in the books. Rhaena's deepest desire has always been to claim a dragon. When the boat arrives and it's time for Rhaena to leave Joffrey and his dragon in the Vale and take the two younger boys + their eggs to Pentos...she walks over to the burnt patch instead, thinking, we assume, about how she maybe should let the boys board the boat themselves and how she could stay in the Vale, find the dragon and claim it.

For further information, his mother is likely supposed to be Saera Targaryen, whose backstory is expanded in the books. Saera was one of the daughters of King Jaehaerys, the old king at the very start of the show who called the Great Council to decide his succession.

Long story short in the books, Saera had a massive falling out with her father after a scandal and was sent to join the faith, but escaped to Essos and for a time worked in a pleasure garden. She eventually became wealthy and successful on her own and had several bastards, although in the books none of them are relevant, and Hugh's parentage is never explored.

The show of course won't go into any of the details of Saera's life, but Hugh's mother is clearly meant to be her.

lffqf8b,lord5678,">I got confused about who the hell Hugh's mother is. So he's Rhaenyra uncle, right?

His mother is the sister of Baelon the Brave, Viserys and Daemon's father, making Hugh their first cousin, and the first cousin once removed of Rhaenyra.

For further information, his mother is likely supposed to be Saera Targaryen, whose backstory is expanded in the books. Saera was one of the daughters of King Jaehaerys, the old king at the very start of the show who called the Great Council to decide his succession.

Long story short in the books, Saera had a massive falling out with her father after a scandal and was sent to join the faith, but escaped to Essos and for a time worked in a pleasure garden. She eventually became wealthy and successful on her own and had several bastards, although in the books none of them are relevant, and Hugh's parentage is never explored.

The show of course won't go into any of the details of Saera's life, but Hugh's mother is clearly meant to be her.

>Ulf is who's son?

Ulf at the very least claims to be the bastard son of Baelon the Brave, making him Viserys and Daemon's half-brother if true.

>Tessarion is Daeron's dragon?

Yes

The dragon Ulf claimed was Silverwing, who was ridden by Queen Alysanne Targaryen, the sister-wife of King Jaehaerys and the great-grandmother of Rhaenyra.

>Addam will not have a dragon so what's his rol√™ exactly?¬†

It's actually Addam who claimed Seasmoke, Alyn is the brother without one. As to his role, just gotta keep watching to find o ut.

>Why Seasmoke accepted Alyn, is Laenor off screen dead?

Yes, Laenor is almost certainly dead. A few episodes ago Rhaenyra commented on Seasmoke being restless, so Laenor likely died recently.

>Why Jace got angry for a plan HIMSELF came up with?????

He planned to allow nobles who had Targaryen ancestry to claim the dragons, he opposes the smallfolk being allowed to claim them since it weakens the perceived superiority of Targaryen blood, harms his own legitimacy, and since the nobility generally look down on the smallfolk, he doesn't want them to gain such power.",3,2024-07-29 03:32:02

Aemond backing off from Dragonstone makes sense regardless of if he saw the other dragons or not (I checked myself though, I doubt he could have). He knows that there are now at least two dragons with riders there and that's enough to make him see sense. His dragon might be the largest but he's also only one person.

Also seeing that Silverwing had a rider probably let's him assume that like big vicious one (forget his name) might be tamed. He was basically flying into an unknown situation.

Rivers allow for way more efficient trade than on land. That means bigger reach and cheaper transport. And since the rivers run through fertile land, it's a double combo. 

That makes them economic powerhouses. There's a reason all major powers in human history were riverine based, exceptions being island nations like England or Japan.

Queen Aemma tells Rheanyra in Ep. 1 that her place and job is to make Heirs, that‚Äôs their duty to the realm. Alicent‚Äôs journey is what happens when that backfires? Vs. Rheanyra who does something different? And had the power/privilege to do things differently. We see even in her position as Queen she‚Äôs undermined by her own court at times. I think this (self discovery retreat) feels like a natural course of action. Alicent is in her 30‚Äôs and her body, her mind, has never been hers.

Yes. It made no sense. That's the point the narrative is making.

Vhagar, and Tessarion. Dreamfyre is flyable, but I don't think Helaena is going to be flying off to battle.

Tahnks for you reply - this is what i thought, just the exchange where she stops the dude on the pier and tells him about his eyes and that his 'mother must have been very beatiful' made me think, what is she talking about? is she the mum? 

Then they have the Targ blood, so... made me wonder.

He's still the one appointed as heir, and if he has to fight to take the throne then that's what he has to do, like his mother did. Like I said, he needs to grow some balls, his position is difficult and will always be difficult just like Rhaenyra's is because she's a woman (and because Daemon exists)

>What happens if any of these 3 random people with dragons bigger than both Syrax and Vermax decide to not follow orders? What happens if they decide that they're better suited to the throne? How would they even stop them?

None of that would change if the riders were Targaryens or bastards, like the other woman said, Rhaenyra's own close family is going to war against her. 

This is also only a problem if they do win the war, so if they didn't get more riders we wouldn't even get to that point, they would just lose and die long before that lol.

lflecj0,Vegetable-Sky1031,"Yeah I agree he‚Äôs definitely trying to get Aegon back to health ASAP, but how would Larys know that two other dragons were also successfully claimed? Or that Silverwing would take Ulf back to KL? It‚Äôs hard to tell how much time is passing, but it looked like that was all in one day. I think (and hope) they would‚Äôve given us a clue that he‚Äôs in the know, or else it‚Äôs a little cheap because it makes him all knowing at some points and clueless at others. I think all he knew was the rumor he heard from the other council member and was probably in the process of verifying.

Getting Aegon back on the throne is basically useless at this point, and if he had more knowledge, telling Aemond would probably be more beneficial in getting Aemond to see him as useful while keeping him preoccupied with the new threat.",1,2024-07-30 03:07:30

When they're grown they can be pretty painful and dangerous but not really lethal or anything, just something to fuck your day/week up. 

Seasmoke knew which cat he wanted, had it all picked out, was watching it from a distance figuring out an angle and then they tried to put that knight out there... so he bailed and basically brought his chosen cat back to the family like ""look, this is the one"".

I thought that maybe he'd claim him (and his brother?) legitimately and give him/them his name. Like Alyn seems more cut out to be a proper heir, and Addam obviously gives him glory as a dragonrider. I think what's bothering him about Jace is not even the lack of blood relation, but the way Jace knows nothing of the sea and isn't of their ways, while Alyn very much is.

And the whole point of Daemon was to show that he's not this all-powerful, successful, cunning leader and that narrative could not have been fulfilled whilst he was still at Dragonstone. And had he accomplished more at Harrenhall and felt less useless, then it would have defeated the point of that arc but at the same time, it was a frustrating plot point nonetheless.

Jacaerys and Lucerys are technically bastards but that didn't stop them from being dragon riders of course. Dragon's don't care about silly little things like who is actually the 'legitimate' heir and who was born out of wedlock or not.

Like maybe Seasmoke was drawn to Adam's ambition, and Vermithor was a fan of Thor's courage and selflessness. Becuase the same dragons rejected other potential riders who also had a blood claim, so you're right it must be more than that.

I think targaryens have basically built themselves up to usually not be fearful because they are convinced that it is in their blood and therefore have nothing to fear. 

Then there's exceptions like Silverwing. This I chock up to disposition. Maybe something about how Ulf sort of gave up and expected himself to die equated to being fearless or maybe Silverwing likes bard like dopes.",10,2024-07-29 02:49:16

Long story short in the books, Saera had a massive falling out with her father after a scandal and was sent to join the faith, but escaped to Essos and for a time worked in a pleasure garden. She eventually became wealthy and successful on her own and had several bastards, although in the books none of them are relevant, and Hugh's parentage is never explored.

lfkdcql,mcmanus2099,">The Blacks having more dragons doesn‚Äôt have that much benefit for Aegon or him short or long term given the costs. I

It's not about that at all. It's just about news on the war distracting Aemond from Aegon and what Larys is doing. We saw from the fact Larys was testing how quickly the Maester could get Aegon back to bed that Larys was paranoid about being discovered by Aemond. He needs Aemond to be distracted so he really loses interest in Aegon and Larys. The best distraction for him right now is Aemond being on the back foot and having to concentrate on the war. 

Larys doesn't have the luxury of thinking about the war, or even next week. He wants Aegon able to walk so he could sit the throne long enough to declare Larys Hand and denounce Aemond. Once he has done all that then Larys will pay attention to the war. 

Cutting Aemond off from whispers is the best way to get him on the back foot and distracted.

>I don‚Äôt think Aemond has caught on to the fact that Larys is helping Aegon get stronger or would care. He knows people are already trying to nurse him back to health already and hasn‚Äôt really done anything to make it harder.

We have seen Larys scared of them being discovered so he at least thinks Aemond would be bothered by what they are doing. No doubt Aemond doesn't care about Aegon being nursed when he thinks there's no chance he'll do more than blink and cough.

Because riding your most valuable asset directly into the enemy's capitol after what felt a lot like baiting/taunting seems like very bad decision making? Daemon is pretty shrewd and careful to only fight battles he's confident he can win, I think it's well within character not to get caught in an obvious trap.

Without even seeing any additional dragons he now has first hand knowledge of at least two adult dragons with riders at Dragonstone. If he's heard Seasmoke's rumors that's potentially 3. All in home turf, and potentially prepared. 

He didn't need to see any extra dragons to know it's a bad deal. A 2v1 could easily result in Daemon's death even if they kill a dragon for it. Protecting himself and Vhagar is the better decision in basically every metric.",6,2024-07-29 19:38:43

Personally I think they could've fixed it by devoting the entirety of episode 3 to Daemon, showing us his initial struggles to be the leader he imagined himself to be, failing to wrangle Riverrun, all while descending into increasingly disturbing nightmares and losing grip on reality. Then we completely drop Daemon for three episodes, which makes it way more interesting when everybody is like ""why won't he respond?"" That would add a lot of tension rather than ""eh, he's just still chopping wood and dreaming about having sex with his mom."" Then when we finally do check in with him again, we see the progress he's made there.

In reality the rider would be blown around like crazy.  Being in open air with no eye-pro, even at 50mph, is really unbearable.  It would be impossible to keep your eyes open at ""dragon speed"".

If his goal is to try and distract Aemond, telling him there‚Äôs been news of riders claiming unclaimed dragons is to his benefit because it distracts Aemond and makes keeps him on Aemonds good side. Hiding that info if he knows it‚Äôs true makes him look incompetent.

I mean Larys is obviously focused on the war because it changes the dynamics in KL. He‚Äôs not involved in planning battles, but what‚Äôs happening in the war will still affect his plans. Knowing the Blacks the attaining new dragon riders affects his plans, because it means they have a growing advantage and can win the war quicker. Both in terms of raw dragon power and what it means for houses who haven‚Äôt taken a side.

Aemond may be removed from the picture sure, but once Aemond is gone, Aegon/the Greens are dead meat. Is the Greens are dead meat, so is Larys.

lfidwnw,kwawkish,"Yeah, I'd take Meleys with a competent rider. I thought it was silly the way Rhaenys decided that the best thing to do when she can't see a giant dragon is to fly low over a cliff that could easily hide a giant dragon. Just fly up and then use the vast speed difference to get away. She's way faster and more agile so in a dragon fight I reckon the medium/large sized dragons have an advantage over the really large ones as long as they are smart about it. Especially if you use tactics like attacking the vulnerable parts like wings.

Edit: I will say though, I'm not expecting it to be an easy match up, I don't think Meleys wins every time against Vhagar (in some hypothetical optimal tactics battle). Vhagar can tank a lot and if you make a mistake and are too slow then you're pretty much stuffed. I just think it's a slight advantage, and in a 3v1 or 2v1 the advantage swings a fair bit towards the multiple smaller dragons, Vhagar just doesn't (or realistically shouldn't) have the speed to keep up with a coordinated attack.",4,2024-07-29 16:38:21

The only dragons that have a good chance are Verm, silverwing, and caraxes, while syrax and seasmoke could harm Vhager they are the most at risk due to size difference.

No it allows Aemond to think about things, plan a course of action with the benefit of time and being in control and so aware of other things. What actually happened is Aemond was totally shocked by it and went into act without thinking. It was such a shock it's going to be all he thinks about.

Seasmoke went to Laenor's half-brother, probably due to familiarity.

Vermithor is fierce and respected that Hugh had no fear and was ready to die.

Granted, it may be technically consistent, but I think it's clearly a matter of the episode showing characters think they're going to die only to subvert it by having the dragon accept them.

For all we know, anyone can claim a dragon as long and the only thing stopping them is that dragons fucking hate that ledge in the Dragonstone cave, and they will burn anyone who tries to claim them in that specific location.

We also don't know if Ulf and Addam were ""prepared"" to die, or if they were still hoping for the best but trying not to move in order to minimize their chances of surviving.

my personal theory is that the personality of the potential rider is considered, maybe Vermithor liked Hughs bravery, and Silverwing liked Ulf clumsiness, but that doesn't explain Seasmoke, maybe he was just lonely and went to the first available rider that he found, or maybe he saw Adam from a distance a few times and thought, that guy seems cool, i'll get him",9,2024-07-29 05:18:46

Only the king, maybe the queen and the heir should've been allowed to bond with dragons. 2-3 dragons is more than enough to keep lords in check and since you can bond with a dragon at any point in life, if something happens to an heir, the next in line can step up at any point.",4,2024-07-29 10:40:17
lfjyur8,TheHabro,">And what are you supposed to do as a king when your heir dies and the spare doesn't have a dragon because you only allowed the future king to claim one.

The king and queen still have dragons though. And it's not like dragon claiming process takes that long.

>Or worse, the heir can't claim a dragon and there is a risk the next generation of Targs might be dragon-less?

A simple solution here is that you cannot be an heir if you don't claim a dragon. And if an heir dies, next in line claims a dragon.

>It's a delicate balance, because if you have too few riders one or two accidents, illnesses or assassinations might leave you with 0.

You could claim same about heirs in general. That's why royal families strive for great quantity of possible heirs. So even if your heir dies there are his brothers, uncles or nephews ready to take the throne (neither Vyserys the First nor the Second were sons to former kings). And the throne would obviously come with a dragon.

Aegon needed 3 (and did fine with 2), Maegor needed 2, Jaehaerys had 4. There was no reason to go above 4. Though I'd argue even 4 is dangerous.

lfk278h,pseudo_nemesis,">In GOT you had a sense that the story was taking place in this huge world filled with important lords and ladies. In HOTD is like no one really matters outside or the Blacks and the Greens.¬†

That does sorta lend to the different stories being told. 

*Game of Thrones* is just that, a game for the throne, anyone can take it potentially. There are no dragons (for the most part) so the iron throne is fair game.

meanwhile, in *House of the Dragon* the focus is on... the house of the dragon: the Targaryens. With dragons being so plentiful amongst their house, they are in a completely different class than the other noble houses. In GOT the Targaryen monopoly has crumbled, which is what opens the doors and leads the way for the events of that show. 

In HOTD, there isn't much of a chance for the other houses to matter in the same way that the Blacks and the Greens do because it's literally impossible for them to have as much power as they do, unlike in GOT where Daenerys is the only person with (a limited number of) dragons.",4,2024-07-29 22:00:46

lfhddah,JetMeIn_02,"She is friendly, but nobody has really had any reason to claim her.  
  
By the time Alysanne died, Daemon and Rhaenys had both claimed their respective dragons I believe. Viserys had already claimed Balerion, although he died. Still, it's unclear whether a rider can have a second dragon, and even if he could he didn't want another.

Syrax seems to have been a cradle egg of Rhaenyra's or at least a hatchling in the pit from when she was young, Seasmoke most likely hatched from an egg of Meleys and Laena probably wouldn't have been allowed to just go to Dragonstone and take a Targaryen dragon. Frankly it's pushing it to allow Velaryons dragons at all, politically speaking.

Going onto the next generation, all of Rhaenyra's children has eggs that hatched, Baela had an egg that hatched and Rhaena is said to have tried and failed. (Unless I got them mixed up). Sunfyre also probably a cradle egg or young Dragonpit dragon. Dreamfyre seems to have been claimed by Helaena when she was young, and Aemond probably wasn't old enough to have them take that risk.  
  
It seems that adult dragon claiming usually happens with an adult Targaryen, with children usually being given eggs or hatchlings.",31,2024-07-29 13:07:53

I really think they can sense certain personality traits and they either vibe with them or they don't based on the individual dragon's preferences. Vermithor was ready to eat Thor until he displayed his strength of character, and my opinion is that changed his mind on the spot.

My original comment was actually in regards to whether a dragon is still ""bound"" if their rider is MIA, such as in the case of Laenor.

Personally I wish they'd just devoted the entirety of episode 3 to Daemon and gave his struggles at Harrenhal some breathing room without making them redundant, then completely dropped him for a few episodes. That would've added more tension when characters are wondering why Daemon isn't sending word because even we aren't sure if he's defected, died or gone mad, but regardless, there's still at least a little dramatic irony since we know more than they do. (It'd also give the other storylines more breathing room as well.)

Then we check in with him again here and see both the progress he's made (personally and with Riverrun) and the progress he *hasn't* made (again, both personally and with Riverrun).

For me it's entirely structural and not about the content. Shove all those dreams into one increasingly batshit episode and I'd be way more receptive to it than every week going ""oh my god please not another.""",19,2024-07-29 16:41:36

Vhagar *wanted* to fly straight into that trap, she fought against turning back. That requires a bond and trust to be built though.

lfgkmof,NinetyFish,"Something they didn't really show in the show is that Corlys is just built fuckin' different.

He is pretty much *the* most famous and successful man in Westeros. The Velaryons were a pretty mediocre house (loyal to the Targaryens, good sailors, but not much else notable) and Corlys single-handedly turned them into a serious competitor with the Lannisters for the richest house in Westeros. And the Lannisters literally live on a gold mine. Corlys did that because he's just that good of a sailor, having gone places the Westerosi rarely dare to. And Corlys did so seven times, each time bringing back shiphulls full of treasure and gold and jewels and exotic spices and artifacts.

So Corlys famously proposed marriage to Rhaenys, who decided to accept, with the famous line, paraphrased: ""If you sail to the ends of the worlds again, yes, I'll come with you. But I'll get there first, as I'll be flying.""

And then when the line of succession accidentally started to point towards Rhaenys (technically, Laenor in the books due to male succession) and then the council chose Viserys, their household was given the chance to claim dragons as a way to avoid any potential conflict (because Rhaenys' succession was actively supported by powerful houses like the Baratheons and Velaryons).",47,2024-07-29 08:38:10

The Targaryens were near the height of their power during his reign, and things were pretty lax in general.

There's not much getting in the way of Laena claiming Vhagar  when all the Targaryens had their own dragons at that point and it would have been foolish for Viserys to try.

Yeah it was an awesome badass shot. You can easily explain it away by any number of reasons - like she was out there about to go after Ulf who had taken off like he had a new sports car.

Maybe she received word (and honestly this is even more likely) that Aemond was spotted and seen flying towards Dragonstone. If so, wouldn't she gear up with everyone on their dragons just in case there's a fight about to go down?

Vhagar is huge but I imagine in the time he was spotted and heading towards her it was more than enough time to rally her dragons.

Jesus cried. Because you see Jace and his siblings as not Targaryens simply because thier parents werent married. 

>Listen here dummy the house Aeyna married into was of the same race and culture as the taragyen house. That is a whole world away from what jace got going on. 

And yet still not Targaryen, so why do you see any of them more Targaryen then the others? Because of a marriage certificate and the colour of their hair?

lfie8bs,CCMarv,"The thing is that the realm would not recognize them as rulers. Anyone giving chance to the thought of taking the crown would do so by marrying into the family rather than actually wearing it. Just as Otto did.

The crown only gets out of the targs by force long after the dragons were lost, at a point where the king was insane, and even then part of the reason Robert was named the king after the rebellion is because he had a link to the Targaryen. That is also why the surviving members are considered a threat by some. 

The crown is seen as a Targaryen right, at this point in history not only by tradition but, still having dragons, also my might and divine ordainment.",1,2024-07-29 16:40:06

He can even do both at the same time, be lord of whispers and serve the king. If the king recovers he will gain more power. If the regents wins the power struggle he has power to lose. 

Those so close to the seat of power do not need to be king to have similar power and influence. That in itself can be motivation enough.",0,2024-07-29 16:25:03
